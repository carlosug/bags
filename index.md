This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for our students in Global Studies. It uses plotting as its motivating example, and is designed to be used in 
both our tutorials, usinf [Data Carpentry][dc-lessons] and [Software Carpentry][swc-lessons] material among other sources. 
This lesson references [JupyterLab][jupyterlab], but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter 
as well as [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com
). Please note that this lesson uses Python 3.
